  "body": "###INTRODUCTION\r\nThis web site contains the source code for the software system MotifGP. This computer program takes as input a set of unaligned DNA sequences and produces a set of sequence motifs.\r\n\r\n###HISTORY\r\n\r\nMotifGP was developed at the University of Ottawa by [Manuel Belmadani](@mbelmadani) under the supervision of [Marcel Turcotte](http://site.uottawa.ca/~turcotte/).\r\n\r\n###PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe project is documented by the following publications.\r\nManuel Belmadani and Marcel Turcotte. (In press) MotifGP: Using multi-objective evolutionary computing for mining network expressions in DNA sequences. In IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB 2016), Chiang Mai, Thailand, October, 5-7, 2016.\r\n\r\nManuel Belmadani. MotifGP: DNA motif discovery using multiobjective evolution. Master of computer science, University of Ottawa, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2016.\r\n\r\n###AVAILABILITY\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/mbelmadani/motifgp)\r\n* [Archive (v 0.1.1)](http://eecs.uottawa.ca/~turcotte/lab/software/motifgp/) \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nContact @mbelmadani, or create an issue on: [https://github.com/mbelmadani/motifgp/issues](https://github.com/mbelmadani/motifgp/issues)\r\n",
