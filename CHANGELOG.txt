=== version 0.2.0 ===
Added MOEA/D multiobjective algorithm (from https://github.com/mbelmadani/moead-py)
Added general purpose "terminator" for timed and generation based (or other) termination conditions
Added MOEA Automatic Termination algorithm and integrated in terminator (from https://github.com/mbelmadani/moea-automatic-termination)
Update Charclass behavior; when no nucleotide is provided, return '[ACGT]' instead of ''. This avoids bloat of dummy (empty) CharacterClasses and uses [ACGT] tokens as placeholders (less negative impact other than temporarily reducing the specificity of matches.)
